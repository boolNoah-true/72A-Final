    <h2>The Mother We Share</h2>
    <p>The Goddess Gaia, creator of life as we know it, was betrayed by her own creations the day she introduced death to her "children". This betrayal birthed conflict between her supporters and those who oppose mortality.  In response to the outbreak of war, she divided her world in twain: Earth became the refuge for those bereft of her inherited powers, while Chaos was reserved for those endowed with them. A century has elapsed since the conflict's inception, and many inhabitants have grown distant from their origins. Yet, new heroes are emerging, drawn together by the mother they share. </p>

One of her contracts involves her and her sword, ensuring victory in almost every fight. She can only communicate telepathically with her twin brother.</p>
